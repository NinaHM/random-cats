# Random Cats
This application shows random images of cats. It uses Swing as GUI, is set up according to the MVC pattern and is multithreaded. The images are retreived from [TheCatApi](https://thecatapi.com/). Images can be saved locally, with the use of a MySQL database to store name and location.
